End Bond Function


# Defined variable
        y = Yield
        face = Face amount
        couponRate = Coupon Rate
        m = Maturity
        ppy = Payments per year


# BondTester - this is a self-unit testing for you to test your code

        y = 0.03
        face = 2000000
        couponRate = 0.04
        m = 10
        ppy = 2
        
        Bond(y, face, couponRate, m, ppy) <- this is the Bond price function you need to code on.
        Bond(3,2000000, 0.04, 10, 2) = 2171686.39
